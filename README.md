Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects
Project 0: Titanic Survival Exploration (Optional)
This project is supported by material found in the Introduction to Machine Learning Foundations Lesson.
Project Description
In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.
Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This project is supported by material found in our Model Evaluation & Validation course. Dependent on your background knowledge of topics such as cross validation, model training and testing, and basic statistics, you may not need to review the entire course prior to completing the project.
Project Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home. 
Project 2: Building a Student Intervention System
This project is supported by material found in our Supervised Learning course. Dependent on your background knowledge of topics in supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and regression, you may not need to review the entire course prior to completing the project.
Project Description
As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now available in real time. Educators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. Toward that end, your goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam. 
Project 3: Creating Customer Segments
This project is supported by material found in our Unsupervised Learning course. Dependent on your background of topics in unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), you may not need to review the entire course prior to completing the project.
Project Description
A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories. 
Project 4: Train a Smartcab How to Drive
This project is supported by material found in our Reinforcement Learning course. Dependent on your background of topics in reinforcement learning techniques such as markov decision processes (MDP) and game theory, you may not need to review the entire course prior to completing the project.
Project Description
A smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive. 
Project 5: Capstone Project
Project Description
In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will
